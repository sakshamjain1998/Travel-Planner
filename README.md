# Travel-Planner
TravelPlanner is an optimization model, which would input the radius of the search area and the place address/postal code you want to visit, for how many days the visit would last, At what time you want to start your trip and from where? Based on this information we would provide the user with the number of places he can visit optimally in the given number of days while maximizing the rating.
